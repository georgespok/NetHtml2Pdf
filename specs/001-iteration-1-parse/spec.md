## Quick Guidelines
- [Yes] Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (include required HTML elements, CSS classes, styling behaviors).
- [Yes] State platform expectations (Windows vs Linux parity) and observable outcomes.
- [No] Avoid HOW to implement (no language, framework, or class design).
- [Audience] Written for business stakeholders, not developers.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature.
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature.
- When a section does not apply, remove it entirely (do not leave "N/A").

### For AI Generation
1. Mark all ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question].
2. Do not guess at unsupported markup or styling; confirm scope with stakeholders.
3. Think like a tester: every vague requirement should fail the "testable" check.
4. Common underspecified areas:
   - User types and permissions
   - HTML surface area (elements, classes, inline styles)
   - Cross-platform behavior (Windows vs Linux)
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Compliance or accessibility needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: Which CSS properties must Iteration 1 handle beyond typography and simple spacing? -> A: Include table borders and cell alignment
- Q: What performance target should Iteration 1 meet for HTML-to-PDF rendering? -> A: No explicit performance target for Iteration 1
- Q: When Iteration 1 encounters unsupported HTML tags, how should the converter respond? -> A: Pass the tag to a generic fallback renderer attempting best effort
- Q: What cross-platform validation approach must Iteration 1 use before release? -> A: Ensure cross-platform compatibility through managed-only dependencies; address issues reactively as they arise
- Q: Should Iteration 1 capture analytics/diagnostics for unsupported CSS or rendering fallbacks? -> A: No - logging warnings is sufficient
- Q: Which statement best captures the out-of-scope limits for Iteration 1? -> A: Exclude media/interactive elements, complex layout (flex/floats/absolute), and external CSS assets

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An SDK consumer wants to convert simple HTML documents containing headings, paragraphs, emphasis, lists, and tables into PDFs using a cross-platform managed library.

### Out of Scope
- Iteration 1 excludes media or interactive HTML (audio, video, canvas), complex layout constructs such as flexbox, floats, and absolute positioning, and loading external CSS asset files; documents requiring these capabilities are deferred to later iterations.

### Edge Cases

#### Unsupported HTML Elements
- **Behavior**: Unsupported tags (e.g., `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`) are processed by a generic fallback renderer
- **Response**: System emits structured warning log: `{Timestamp} [WARNING] FallbackRenderer: Unsupported element '<tagname>' processed with best-effort rendering`
- **Recovery**: Element content is rendered as plain text with preserved structure, element is marked with appropriate DocumentNodeType
- **Error Handling**: If fallback rendering fails, element is skipped with error log: `{Timestamp} [ERROR] FallbackRenderer: Failed to process '<tagname>', element skipped`

#### Empty and Malformed Elements
- **Empty inline elements**: Collapse without emitting content, no warning generated
- **Empty block elements**: Render as empty paragraph with minimal height (4pt)
- **Malformed markup**: AngleSharp normalizes before parsing; if normalization fails, element becomes `Fallback` entry
- **Recovery**: Invalidly nested markup is restructured according to HTML5 parsing rules
- **Error Handling**: Severely malformed markup that cannot be parsed raises `HtmlParsingException` with specific error message

#### CSS Class and Style Issues
- **Missing CSS classes**: Fall back to inherited styles, emit warning: `{Timestamp} [WARNING] CssResolver: CSS class 'classname' not found, using inherited styles`
- **Invalid CSS properties**: Ignore invalid properties, emit warning: `{Timestamp} [WARNING] CssResolver: Invalid CSS property 'property' ignored`
- **Malformed CSS values**: Use default value for property type, emit warning: `{Timestamp} [WARNING] CssResolver: Invalid value for 'property', using default`
- **Recovery**: System continues processing with available valid styles, no exceptions thrown for CSS issues

#### Performance and Resource Constraints
- **Large HTML documents**: Process in chunks if document exceeds 10MB, emit info log: `{Timestamp} [INFO] HtmlParser: Processing large document in chunks`
- **Memory constraints**: If memory usage exceeds 500MB, abort with `OutOfMemoryException` and clear error message
- **Timeout handling**: If rendering exceeds 30 seconds, abort with `TimeoutException` and partial PDF output
- **Recovery**: System attempts to complete partial rendering before aborting, logs completion percentage


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST parse and render the following HTML elements into PDF output: div, p, span, strong, b, i, br, ul, li, ol, table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td, section, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support CSS class references and inline styles limited to the following properties on supported elements: `font-weight`, `font-style`, `text-decoration`, `line-height`, `color`, `background-color`, `margin`, `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, `margin-right`, `padding`, `padding-top`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`, `padding-right`. CSS classes MUST be defined within `<style>` tags in the same HTML document and map to this property set. Classes defined within the document that map to this property set MUST resolve consistently with inline styles.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to provide HTML content through the public `HtmlConverter` API for rendering.
- **FR-004**: System MUST rely solely on managed .NET dependencies (QuestPDF, AngleSharp) without introducing GDI+ or native rendering libraries to ensure inherent cross-platform compatibility. **MUST** validate managed-only constraint through dependency audit (`dotnet list package --include-transitive`) confirming all dependencies are managed .NET libraries. Cross-platform issues will be addressed reactively as they arise.
- **FR-005**: System MUST route unsupported HTML elements to a generic fallback renderer that attempts best-effort output and surfaces clear warnings describing the degraded behavior.
- **FR-006**: System MUST include regression tests and fixtures covering each supported tag and representative combinations (paragraphs, lists, tables). **MUST** follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, writing tests FIRST before implementing any feature, following the red-green-refactor cycle.
- **FR-007**: System MUST emit structured warning logs describing fallback rendering events using format: `{Timestamp} [WARNING] {Component}: {Message}` with severity level WARNING. No additional analytics storage is required in Iteration 1.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support table border styling including `border`, `border-collapse`, `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color` properties and cell alignment properties including `text-align` (horizontal alignment) and `vertical-align` (vertical alignment) in addition to typography and spacing controls. Default values: `border-collapse: separate`, `text-align: left`, `vertical-align: top`. CSS inheritance follows standard cascade rules with inline styles taking precedence over class styles.
- **FR-009**: System MUST capture render timing metrics for monitoring and future performance optimization. No explicit performance targets are established for Iteration 1 - focus is on measurement and data collection only. Timing data MUST include total render duration and be stored in application logs.
- **FR-010**: System MUST achieve comprehensive test coverage for classes with business logic, algorithms, and complex behavior. **MUST** create unit tests for individual methods, integration tests for component interactions, and contract tests for API boundaries. Focus test coverage on High Priority areas: classes with business logic, algorithms, validation, parsing, rendering, and complex state management. Medium Priority areas include classes with moderate complexity, data transformation, or integration points. Low Priority areas (simple data containers, property setters, enums, basic value objects) are optional. Exempt areas include auto-generated code, simple constructors without logic, and trivial getters/setters.
