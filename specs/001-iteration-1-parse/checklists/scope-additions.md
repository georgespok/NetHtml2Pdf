---

## Edge Case Coverage

### CSS Parsing Edge Cases

- [X] CHK064 - Are requirements specified for negative margin values in shorthand? [FR-002a specifies "standard CSS syntax"; negative values are valid CSS; css-margin-shorthand.md parser accepts any numeric value]
- [X] CHK065 - Are requirements defined for zero-value handling (e.g., "margin: 0", "border: none")? [css-margin-shorthand.md shows "margin: 0" as valid 1-value pattern; css-border-shorthand.md §Style Component shows "none" as valid style]
- [X] CHK066 - Are requirements specified for whitespace handling in shorthand values (multiple spaces, tabs, newlines)? [css-margin-shorthand.md §Parser Implementation: "Tokenize value by whitespace" handles multiple spaces; AngleSharp normalizes CSS]
- [X] CHK067 - Are requirements defined for case-insensitivity in CSS keywords (e.g., "SOLID" vs "solid")? [css-border-shorthand.md parsing algorithm normalizes to lowercase; standard CSS behavior]
- [X] CHK068 - Are requirements specified for unitless zero values (e.g., "margin: 0 10px" vs "margin: 0px 10px")? [Standard CSS behavior: unitless zero is valid; parser handles per CSS spec]

### Multi-Page Edge Cases

- [X] CHK069 - Are requirements defined for handling very large page counts (e.g., 100+ pages)? [spec.md §Edge Cases Performance: 30-second timeout for ≤10MB documents applies regardless of page count; QuestPDF handles multi-page natively]

- [X] CHK071 - Are requirements defined for extremely long header/footer content that exceeds available space? [AC-011.10: "Headers/footers expand dynamically to fit content"; QuestPDF layout engine handles automatically]
- [X] CHK072 - Are requirements specified for header/footer content that contains page breaks or unsupported elements? [AC-011.9: "same parsing and rendering as page content"; unsupported elements use fallback renderer per FR-005]

### API State Edge Cases

- [X] CHK073 - Are requirements defined for calling Build() multiple times on the same instance? [data-model.md §PdfBuilder: "Multiple Build() calls produce independent PDFs with accumulated state at time of call"]
- [X] CHK074 - Are requirements specified for calling SetHeader/SetFooter multiple times (overwrite vs accumulate)? [spec.md §Edge Cases, pdfbuilder-api.md §SetHeader/SetFooter: "Last call wins, previous content is replaced"]
- [X] CHK075 - Are requirements defined for interleaving AddPage and SetHeader/SetFooter calls in non-standard order? [CHK031 answer: SetHeader/SetFooter can be called before or after AddPage; headers/footers are global and apply to all pages]

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [X] CHK078 - Are memory usage requirements defined for accumulating multiple pages before Build()? [spec.md §Edge Cases Performance: 500MB memory limit applies to entire Build() operation including accumulated pages]

### Maintainability

- [X] CHK079 - Are code organization requirements specified for CSS shorthand parsing (reusable utility, integrated into CssStyleUpdater)? [data-model.md §CssStyleMap Extended §Parser Extensions: "CssStyleUpdater.ParseMarginShorthand" and "ParseBorderShorthand" new methods]
- [X] CHK080 - Are architecture requirements defined for multi-page state management in PdfBuilder? [data-model.md §PdfBuilder Internal State: "_pages (List<string>), _header (string?), _footer (string?)"]

### Compatibility

- [X] CHK081 - Are cross-platform requirements validated for margin/border rendering (Windows vs Linux consistency)? [FR-004: Managed-only dependencies ensure cross-platform compatibility; applies to all CSS features including shorthands]
- [X] CHK082 - Are cross-platform requirements specified for multi-page PDF generation? [FR-004: QuestPDF is managed .NET library; multi-page rendering inherits same cross-platform compatibility as single-page]

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### External Dependencies

- [X] CHK083 - Are QuestPDF multi-page API requirements documented (Document.Create, Header, Footer, Page sections)? [plan.md §Phase 0 Research §Multi-Page PDF Generation: "QuestPDF natively supports multi-page documents through fluent API"; data-model.md §Multi-Page PDF Generation Flow]
- [X] CHK084 - Are AngleSharp CSS parsing capabilities verified for shorthand property support? [plan.md notes AngleSharp is used for HTML parsing; CSS shorthand expansion implemented in CssStyleUpdater, not delegated to AngleSharp]

### Implementation Assumptions

- [X] CHK085 - Is the assumption that CssStyleMap needs extension for shorthand properties validated? [data-model.md §CssStyleMap Extended: "No New Properties Required - Shorthand values expanded to existing longhand properties"]
- [X] CHK086 - Is the assumption that RendererOptions/ConverterOptions suffices for page configuration validated? [data-model.md §ConverterOptions: "Current scope: no new properties needed for multi-page/headers/footers"]
- [X] CHK087 - Are assumptions about QuestPDF header/footer rendering capabilities documented and validated? [plan.md §Phase 0 Research: "Headers/footers defined once and automatically repeated"; "Dynamic height supported through QuestPDF's layout engine"]

### Breaking Change Impact

- [X] CHK088 - Are all affected unit tests identified for API signature change? [AC-003.12: "All existing unit tests are updated to use new PdfBuilder API"; pdfbuilder-api.md §Breaking Changes §Migration Steps item 6]
- [X] CHK089 - Are PdfBuilder constructor requirements documented for new state management? [data-model.md §PdfBuilder Constructor Dependencies lists IHtmlParser, IPdfRendererFactory, IOptions<RendererOptions>]
- [X] CHK090 - Are quickstart.md and documentation update requirements specified for API changes? [plan.md §Phase 1 Progress Tracking shows quickstart.md updated; pdfbuilder-api.md §Breaking Changes includes migration examples]

---

## Traceability

### Requirement IDs & References

- [X] CHK091 - Is a requirement ID scheme established for the four new features? [FR-002a: CSS Shorthands (margin/border combined), FR-003: PdfBuilder API, FR-011: Multi-Page PDF with Headers/Footers; all in spec.md §Requirements]
- [X] CHK092 - Are CSS property parsing requirements traceable to specific CssStyleUpdater and CssStyleMap changes? [data-model.md §CssStyleMap Extended §Parser Extensions explicitly names CssStyleUpdater.ParseMarginShorthand and ParseBorderShorthand methods]
- [X] CHK093 - Are multi-page API requirements traceable to IPdfBuilder interface and PdfBuilder implementation? [data-model.md §IPdfBuilder and §PdfBuilder sections provide complete interface/class definitions; FR-003 and FR-011 trace to these entities]
- [X] CHK094 - Are test requirements traceable to specific test fixture files and test methods? [css-margin-shorthand.md §Test Cases, css-border-shorthand.md §Test Cases, pdfbuilder-api.md §Test Cases all list specific test file names and method names]

---

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

### Outstanding Ambiguities

- [X] CHK095 - Is it ambiguous whether margin/border shorthands support CSS variables (e.g., "margin: var(--spacing)")? [RESOLVED: plan.md §Technical Context: "no CSS variables/calc() in Iteration 1"; out of scope]
- [X] CHK096 - Is it ambiguous whether AddPage() should validate HTML before accepting it or defer to Build()? [RESOLVED: pdfbuilder-api.md §AddPage validates input immediately (null/empty checks); HTML parsing deferred to Build()]
- [X] CHK097 - Is it ambiguous whether headers/footers should support dynamic content (page numbers, dates)? [RESOLVED: Out of scope for Iteration 1; headers/footers use static HTML content per spec.md FR-011]
- [X] CHK098 - Is it ambiguous what happens if SetHeader/SetFooter is called after AddPage for some pages? [RESOLVED: CHK031 and CHK075 clarify headers/footers are global and apply to ALL pages regardless of call order]

### Potential Conflicts

- [X] CHK099 - Do margin shorthand requirements conflict with existing BoxSpacing implementation strategy? [NO CONFLICT: data-model.md shows shorthand expands to existing longhand properties; no BoxSpacing changes needed]
- [X] CHK100 - Does the AddPage state management approach conflict with the current stateless HtmlConverter design? [ACKNOWLEDGED: Breaking change by design; plan.md §Constitution Check V justifies deviation]
- [X] CHK101 - Do header/footer requirements conflict with existing page margin handling in RendererOptions? [NO CONFLICT: pdfbuilder-api.md §Dynamic Height shows QuestPDF adjusts content area automatically; no manual margin conflicts]
